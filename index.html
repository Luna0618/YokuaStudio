            Lately, I’ve been noticing how my sentences have a tendency to keep going when I write them onscreen. This
            goes
            for concentrated writing as well as correspondence. (Twain probably believed that correspondence, in an
            ideal
            world, also demands concentration. But he never used email.) Last week I caught myself packing four
            conjunctions
            into a three-line sentence in an email. That’s inexcusable. Since then, I have tried to eschew conjunctions
            whenever possible. Gone are the commas, the and’s, but’s, and so’s; in are staccato declaratives. Better to
            read
            like bad Hemingway than bad Faulkner.

            Length–as we all know, and for lack of a more original or effective way of saying it–matters. But (ahem),
            it’s
            also a matter of how you use it. Style and length are technically two different things.

            Try putting some prose onscreen, though, and they mix themselves up pretty quickly. This has much to do with
            the
            time constraints we claim to feel in the digital age. We don’t have time to compose letters and post them
            anymore–much less pay postage, what with all the banks kinda-sorta losing our money these days–so we blast a
            few
            emails. We don’t have time to talk, so we text. We don’t have time to text to specific people, so we update
            our
            Facebook status. We don’t have time to write essays, so we blog.

            I’m less interested
            Most important: What exactly are we writing when we’re doing all of this writing? I won’t pretend to coin a
            whole new term here; I still think the best we can muster is a more fitting analogue. And if we must find an
            analogue in an existing literary unit, I propose the paragraph. Our constant writing has begun to feel like
            a
            neverending digital paragraph. Not a tight, stabbing paragraph from The Sun Also Rises or even a graceful,
            sometimes-slinking, sometimes-soaring paragraph from Absalom! Absalom!, I mean a convoluted, haphazard,
            meandering paragraph, something like Kerouac’s original draft of On the Road–only taped together by bytes.
            And 1
            percent as interesting.

            Paragraphs, particularly those that wrap from one page to the next, inherently possess a necessary
            suspension
            that tightens the reader’s focus yet breaks down the narrative into digestable sections. Just like emails or
            blogs or texts. The mental questions while reading all of these feel the same:

            “Is this the last line or is there more?”
